\subsection{How to use?}
	Simple. In your C program, add this line:
	<pre>#include "cn_vec.h"</pre>
	From there on out, you can now use the functions in the CN_Vec library. Make sure both "cn_vec.c" and "cn_vec.h" are in yout directory with your program.


\subsection{List of functions}On this domain, I have included a manual for every function in the library. Feel free to check it out if you have any questions in regards to what functions the library contains.

Here is a list of every function available separated in categories:

\subsubsection{Initializer}\begin{itemize}
	\item new_cn_vec (Use cn_vec_init instead)

\end{itemize}
