<h1>Introduction to GDB</h1>
<h3>Because debugging is hard</h3>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>When you are programming in languages like C/C++, chances are that you get errors such as segmentation faults.
You know these errors well, probably. And you probably have come to hate them <i>a lot</i>.
However, as crazy as it sounds, <i>you want segmentation faults</i> when your program messes up. Yeah I said it, segmentation faults are your friends.
And I say that because they are errors that you can debug a lot more easily than ones that don't crash your program.


Now why do I mention all of this?
There are tools out there that can, when your program segfaults, tell you <i>exactly</i> where in your code the issue is. I'll introduce you to a fan-favourite, GDB.
GDB can, when used correctly, be used when your program segfaults to find out what variable, function, pointer, etc causes the crash.</p>
